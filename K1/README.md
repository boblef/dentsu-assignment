# K1 MNIST

### Intro

There is a jupyter notebook, `notebook/K1.ipynb`, which is where you can see the code with explanations.

### How to run the code

You can run the code from the top to down.

### What I used

- A CNN model with and without dropout
- See if there is any problems such as overfitting
- Tackle the problem
- How to improve the model's performance with Hyperas which is a library for hyperparameter search for Keras model
